Question #5: Array Sorting
Write an algorithm that sorts an array without using the sort() method. There are many different sorting algorithms - take the time to read about the following:

Quick sort
Merge sort
Heap sort
Insertion sort
Bubble sort
Selection sort
You may implement any of the above algorithms (or your own) to solve the problem - as long as it doesn't use sort().

Example
Input: [9, 2, 7, 12]

Output: [2, 7, 9, 12]

function arraySort(array) {
  let done = false;
  while (!done) {
    done = true;
    for (let i = 1; i < array.length; i++) {
      if (array[i] < array[i-1]) {
        let temp = array[i];
        array[i] = array[i-1];
        array[i-1] = temp;
        done = false;
      }
    }
  }
  return array;
}
